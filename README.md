# `Bookstore Management System in Java` - Freshman Year 
## Description
Very first coding assignment mimicking an online bookstore where users are able to order books, become a premium member, request to restock items, and compare inventory stock. 
Main objective of this project was to get comfortable working with Java including class design, abstract classes, and inheritance.
